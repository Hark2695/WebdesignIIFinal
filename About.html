        <h1>Hey there...</h1>
        <p>
            ... my name is Sophie Harkrider and I moved to Denver, CO in 2020. I am originally from Cologne, Germany and decided to move here to start a life together with my 
            husband in Denver, Colorado. I earned my BA degree in early childhood education and graduated from TH KÃ¶ln in 2020. I worked in a Montessori school for a couple years before I noticed that I needed a change. 
            I have always followed hobbies that are more creative and alternative. In my free time I would work on wedding/birthday/baby shower invitations for friends or build out websites for non profit
            organizations. In 2022 I decided that that's the path I want to go! I wanted to make my hobby, that I felt so passionate about, to my profession! 
            I started my journey with CCD in 2022 and I am currently in my last semester. After a couple typography classes I noticed quickly that I really enjoy working with type and layout. 
            Currently I am working as a freelancer for a couple small businesses and I can't wait to step into the graphic design world full time!
